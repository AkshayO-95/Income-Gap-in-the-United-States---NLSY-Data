# Income-Gap-in-the-United-States---NLSY-Data

## Research Questions

There are two research questions: 1) Whethere the income gap between men and women is significant? 2) Whether income gap depends significantly on variables : Race, Birth Country, Urban/Rural and Family Size?

The variables that I am taking for this analysis are : income,gender,race,birth_country,family_size and urban/rural.

## Description of variables:

Income(2012): Income is a numeric variable. Income is in US$. There are some values (top 2%) which are top-coded. Itâ€™s income from wages and salary.

Gender(1978): Gender is a categorical variable. There are two categories- Male and Female (Men or Women).

Race(1978): Race is a categorical variable. There are three categories- Black, Hispanic and Others(Non-Black Non-Hispanic).

Birth Country(1978):Birth Country is a categorical variable. There are two categories- Outside US and (in) US.

Urban/ Rural(2012): Gender is a categorical variable. There are two categories- Male and Female (Men or Women).

Family Size(2012): Family is a discrete numeric variable.

## Requirements :

- R studio 

- Packages - tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr

## Conclusions made after the analysis 

- There is a significant income gap between men and women (income and gender)for the participants in the nlsy.data dataset.

- From the analysis we can say that race and family_size are significant predictors for income gap between men and women. On the other side the birth_country and urban_or_rural are not significant predictors on income gap for the given dataset.
